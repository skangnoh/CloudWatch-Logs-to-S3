# CloudWatch-Logs-to-S3

Cloud watch Logs are important for debugging issues. 
Sometimes we may need old logs for debugging and analysis but we may not be assessing them very frequently. 
Moving them to a more cost effective storage like S3 helps reduce the cost of 
storing the longs for long without loosing flexibility of debugging live issues directly from the cloudwatch console

Use the Zip file and put in an S3 bucket and deploy the template.
